## 11/1/2025 - Build the schematic + started to build the drone outline  

I forgot to journal the building of the drone schematic. All I have done so far is build the schematic based off of the guide I am using. After that, I converted it all to the PCB, and started to build the outline. I am trying to make the outline look like how they made it; the shape of a drone. The issue I can into was that I made the board outline as a trace and not under `edge.cuts`, so now I need to fix it all.
